Optimized confidence rate =  K . 1/(âˆšP) . 1/A . CF

Where,

P  = Population of borough
A  = Area of borough (in square km)
K  = large constant to offset decimal values in result here we used, 10^6 
CF = unoptimized confidence rate calculated by comparing percentage share 
     of a crime for a month with the rest of the months for that year and 
     averaging these across the training years
