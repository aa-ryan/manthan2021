	> Proposed an approach in which
		they highlighted the usage of data mining techniques, clustering
		and classification for effective investigation of crimes and criminal
		identification by developing a system named Intelligent Crime
		Investigation System (ICSIS) that could identify a criminal based
		up on the evidence collected from the crime location. They used
		clustering to identify the crime patterns which are used to commit
		crimes knowing the fact that each crime has certain patterns. The
		database is trained with a supervised learning algorithm, Naïve
		Bayes to predict possible suspects from the criminal records. His
		approach includes developing a multi-agent for crime pattern
		identification. There are agents for the place, time, role trademark
		and substance of criminals which separates the role of the
		criminals in components. The system is a multi-agent system and
		made with managed Java Beans. It makes it easy to encapsulate
		the requested entities in the work into objects and returns it to the
		bean for exposing properties. Classifying the criminals/ suspects is
		based on the Naïve Bayes classifier for identifying most possible
		suspects from crime data. Clustering the criminals is based on the
		model to help to identify patterns of committing crimes.

	> Done a work which will display 
		high probability for crime occurrence and can visualize crime prone
		areas. Instead of just focusing on the crime occurrences, they are
		focusing mainly on the crime factors of each day. They used the
		Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression and SVM classifiers for
		classification of crime patterns and crime factors of each day.
		Their method consists of a pattern identification phase which can
		identify the trends and patterns in crime using the Apriori
		Algorithm. The prediction of crime spots is done with the help of
		Decision Tree algorithm which will detect the crime possible
		areas and their patterns.

	> Performed a crime analysis work based on the
		clustering and classification techniques. Their work includes the
		extraction of crime patterns by crime analysis based on available
		criminal information, prediction of crimes based on the spatial
		distribution of existing data and crime recognition. They proposed
		a model in which the analysis and prediction of crimes are done
		through the optimization of outlier detection operator parameters
		which is performed through the Genetic Algorithm. The features
		are weighted in this model and the low-value features were
		deleted through selecting a suitable threshold. After which the
		clusters are clustered by the k-means clustering algorithm for
		classification of crime dataset

		* Rizwan et al. [22] have performed classification of crime
		dataset to predict Crime Category for different states of the United
		States of America. The crime dataset that they used in this research
		is real in nature. That is, it was collected from socio-economic data
		from 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US
		LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR. Their
		work compared the two different classification algorithms namely,
		Naïve Bayesian and Decision Tree for predicting Crime Category
		for different states in USA. The results from their experiment
		showed that, Decision Tree algorithm out performed Naïve
		Bayesian algorithm and achieved 83.9519% Accuracy in
		predicting Crime Category for different states of USA.

	Analysis using K-Means Clustering”, International Journal

	* Agarwal et al. [3] used the rapid miner tool for analyzing the
	crime rates and anticipation of crime rate using different 
	data mining techniques.	Their work done is for crime analysis using
	the K-Means Clustering algorithm. The main objective of their
	crime analysis work is to extract the crime patterns, predict the
	crime based on the spatial distribution of existing data and
	detection of crime.
