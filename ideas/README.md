* Add relevant points relating dataset and ideas on how to process it.

* Calculate percentage of each crime for each month and compare it too the average of the same crime for the rest of the months and if it is significantly highter we can predict it will happen again that month next year
* Concept for grand average.
* Aim for short-term crime event prediction we partition a day into total eight intervals and each interval spans 3 hours. Crime prediction in finer temporal grain will help the police to design their patrol strategy dynamically and it will increase the probability to reduce crime rate more effectively.
